# Vendor CSS Files
    - Normalize.css
        - Normalize.css resets the applied css styles but keeps the basic styles which doesn't need to be reset like header, paragraph, etc.
        - If you are using html5boilerplate.css, it already includes normalize.css.
        - So, use normalize.css when you want to start styling from scratch.
    - Responsive Grid System
        - Responsive grid system isn’t a framework. It’s not a boilerplate either. It’s a quick, easy and flexible way to create a responsive web site.
        - You can download the .zip file, it contains many .css files, if you are using normalize.css as resetter, then you can skip html5reset.css file provided in .zip file. 
        - You can import rest .css files into one single grid.css file. So in your .html, you just need to import only grid.css file.
